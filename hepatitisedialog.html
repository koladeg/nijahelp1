        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Hepatitis E is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV) which is transmitted via the faecal-oral route.<br />
         Since the development of jaundice (yellow discoloration of the skin and sclera of the eyes, dark urine and pale stools)) is a characteristic feature of liver disease,<br />
         a correct diagnosis can only be made by testing patients' sera. In general, hepatitis E is a self-limiting viral infection followed by recovery.<br />
          Prolonged viraemia or faecal shedding are unusual and chronic infection does not occur. </p>

           <h3>Symptoms</h3>
           <h5>The symptoms of hepatitis E range from subclinical to severe and act from three to eight weeks after infection</h5>
           <ol>
           <li>Jaundice</li>
           <li>Anorexia (loss of appetite)</li>
           <li>An enlarged, tender liver (hepatomegaly)</li>
           <li>Abdominal pain and tenderness</li>
           <li>Nausea and vomiting.</li>
           <li>Fever</li>

           <h3>Prevention</h3>
           <ol>
           <li>Drinking safe water</li>
           <li>Proper disposal of sanitary waste</li>
           <li>Detection of outbreaks, source of infection and mode of transmission</li>
           </ol>
        </div>
    
        <div data-role="collapsible" data-inset="false">
           <h3>Treatment</h3>
           <p>HEV infections are usually self-limited, and hospitalization is generally not required. <br />
           However, hospitalization is required for severe hepatitis and should be considered for infected pregnant women.<br />
           As no specific therapy is capable of altering the course of acute hepatitis E infection,<br />
           prevention is the most effective approach against the disease.</p>
