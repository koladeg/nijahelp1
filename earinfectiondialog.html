        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>An ear infection (acute otitis media) is most often a bacterial or viral infection that affects the middle ear, the air-filled space behind the eardrum that contains the tiny vibrating bones of the ear.<br />
         Children are more likely than adults to get ear infections</p>

        <div data-role="collapsible" data-inset="false">
           <h3>Symptoms</h3>
           <ol>
           <li>Earache is common but does not always occur.</li>
           <li>Dulled hearing may develop for a few days.</li>
           <li>fever is common.</li>
           <li>Children may feel sick or vomit and can be generally unwell.</li>
           <li>Young babies cannot point to their pain. One of the causes of a hot, irritable, crying baby is an ear infection</li>
           <li>Sometimes the eardrum bursts (perforates). This lets out infected mucus and the ear becomes runny for a few days. As the pain of earache is due to a tense eardrum, a burst eardrum often relieves the pain. A perforated eardrum usually heals within a few weeks after the infection clears.</li>
           </ol>

           <h3>Prevention</h3>
          
           <p>It is common for children to have two or more bouts of ear infection throughout childhood.<br />
               In most cases, there is nothing you can do to prevent the infection from occurring. <br />
               However, there is some evidence to suggest that an ear infection is less likely to develop:</p>
           <ol>
           <li>In breast-fed children.</li>
           <li>In children who live in a smoke-free home. Passive smoking of babies and children can increase the risk of developing ear infections, and various other problems.</li>
             </ol><p>Occasionally, some children have recurring bouts of ear infections close together. If this occurs, a specialist may advise a long course of antibiotics to prevent further bouts from occurring.</p>

           <h3>Treatment</h3>
           <p>Most bouts of ear infection will clear on their own without treatment within 2-3 days. <br />
           The immune system can usually clear germs (bacteria or viruses) that cause ear infections.<br />
            However, treatments that may be advised include the following:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Painkillers</li>
            <li>Antibiotics - are prescribed in some cases only</li>
            </ol>
