        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>For far too many people, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are an embarrassing, painful and sometimes deadly casualty of sexual intercourse.<br />
         Armed with the right information, they're often preventable. But, you also need to mind your ABCs - know about abstinence, be faithful and, if you're having premarital sex, use condoms to protect you and your partner.</p>

           <h3>Get the Facts</h3>
           <p>What is an STI? It's an infection where a virus, germ, bacteria or parasite has been passed from one person to another through intimate or sexual contact.<br />
            That contact generally involves the genitals, mouth or rectum. Some infections are curable, while others like HIV/AIDS can be treated but not cured.<br />
             There exist more than 20 kinds of STIs. A few of the most common include Herpes, Chlamydia, Gonorrhea and Syphilis</p>
             <p>You can suffer from more than one STI at the same time and usually when you are found to have one infection, you need to be tested for other sexually transmitted infections including HIV.</p>
             <p>It is important to point out that a person suffering from an STI is at a greater risk of being infected with HIV, because the STI opens the way for the virus to enter the body.<br />
              If you have been found to have an STI, take a HIV test too. Those who are infected with both an STI and HIV also spread the HIV faster to other people.<br />
               It is therefore important that they get treated as soon as possible</p>

           <h3>Prevention</h3>
           <ol>
           <p>Avoid the psychological, physical and economic consequences of STIs by practicing safer sex.<br />
            Want 100 percent protection? Abstain from sex altogether until you enter a serious and trusting relationship.<br />
             But if you aren't willing to do that, then protect yourself by using a condom every time during intercourse, especially if you aren't in a monogamous relationship.<br />
              It also helps to know your partner's sexual history. Find out if you are his/her only sexual partner, as the more partners one has, the more at risk you become.<br />
               Stay aware, be responsible and make your sexual health a top priority.</p>

           <h3>Symptoms</h3>
           <ol>
           <p>How do you know if you've contracted an STI? Ultimately, it depends on the STI. Some symptoms arrive quickly, and can include an unusual discharge, painful urination, sores, redness or bumps in the genital area.<br />
            Symptoms also differ for men and women. An infection such as HIV can take up to six months to detect.<br />
            If you notice any symptoms at all, seek medical attention immediately and avoid any further sexual intercourse until you've been treated.</p>
