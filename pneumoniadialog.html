        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Pneumonia is a lung infection that can make you very sick and it's  caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites.<br />
         You may cough, run a fever, and have a hard time breathing.<br />
         For most people, pneumonia can be treated at home. It often clears up in 2 to 3 weeks.<br />
         But older adults, babies, and people with other diseases can become very ill. They may need to be in the hospital.<br /></p>
         <p>Pneumonia usually starts when you breathe the germs into your lungs. You may be more likely to get the disease after having a cold or the flu.<br />
          These illnesses make it hard for your lungs to fight infection, so it is easier to get pneumonia. Having a long-term, or chronic, disease like asthma, heart disease, cancer, or diabetes also makes you more likely to get pneumonia</p>

           <h3>Symptoms</h3>
           <ol>
           <li>Cough <br />
           You will likely cough up mucus (sputum) from your lungs. Mucus may be rusty or green or tinged with blood. </li>
           <li>Fever</li>
           <li>Fast breathing and feeling short of breath</li>
           <li>Shaking and "teeth-chattering" chills</li>
           <li>Chest pain that often feels worse when you cough or breathe in</li>
           <li>Fast heartbeat</li>
           <li>Feeling very tired or very weak</li>
           <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
           <li>Diarrhea</li>
           </ol>

           <h3>Prevention</h3>
           <ol>
           <li>Stop smoking: You're more likely to get pneumonia if you smoke</li>
           <li>Avoid people who have infections that sometimes lead to pneumonia.</li>
           <li>Stay away from people who have colds, the flu, or other respiratory tract infections.</li>
           <li>If you haven't had measles or chickenpox or if you didn't get vaccines against these diseases, avoid people who have them.</li>
           <li>Wash your hands often: This helps prevent the spread of viruses and bacteria that may cause pneumonia</li>
           <li>Vaccines are available.
               <ul>
                  <li>Children get the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) as a routine vaccination.<br />
                   Older adults (age 65 or older), people who smoke, and people who have some long-term (chronic) conditions also need the pneumococcal vaccine.<br />
                   Depending on age and other things, adults can get PCV or the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV). Some adults need both types.</li>
               </ul>
