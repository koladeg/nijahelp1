        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Osteoporosis is when your bones get weak and break easily, even from bumping into a table or sneezing. Hip, spinal, and wrist fractures are the most common broken bones.<br />
         According to the National Osteoporosis Foundation of SA, one in three women get this disease.</p>

           <h3>Symptoms</h3>
           <ol>
           <li>Back or neck pains.</li>
           <li>A hump in your back or a bent spine.</li>
           <li>Easily-broken bones, even if you don't fall or have injuries.</li>
           <li>Tenderness in your bones. </li>
           </ol>

           <h3>Prevention</h3>
           <ol>
           <p>Women who don't get enough calcium and exercise when they're young can get the disease.<br />
           It usually shows up after you turn 50 or when you have menopause. However, women as young as 25 do get the disease, <br />
           so if you suspect anything, speak to your doctor or health care provider. Your bones start losing calcium when you turn 30,<br />
           but you can keep them strong by eating well and exercising.</p>

           <h3>Treatment</h3>
           <p>Start a fitness routine when you're young. Develop healthy eating habits and make sure you get enough calcium.<br />
           If you can't eat foods with calcium in them, take vitamins and supplements. Talk to your doctor or health care provider to get more information</p>
