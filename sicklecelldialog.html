        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>People who have sickle cell are anaemic, meaning their blood doesn't carry enough oxygen, which can make them sick.<br />
         Their haemoglobin, a chemical in the blood cell, is misshapen and can't easily move through the blood vessels.<br />
          When the vessels get blocked, it is very painful.</p>
          <p>Sickle cell is genetic and is from the parents. Everyone gets half of their genes (the building blocks of our body) from their mother and half from their father. <br />
          If a mother and father both have one sickle cell gene, they can have a child with the disease, even though they may not have it themselves.<br />
          It is common amongst people of Central and West African descent.</p>

           <h3>Diagnosing sickle cell anaemia</h3>
           <p>Anyone can be tested for sickle cell. If you are planning on becoming a parent, you and your partner should get tested, especially if you are Central African or have parents from a region where sickle cell is common.<br />
            Your doctor can do the test or can send you to a genetic counselor (a doctor who deals with genetic diseases).</p>
           <p>If you have a baby, he or she should be tested for the disease and the gene. It's important to know if your baby has it especially for when he or she gets older.</p>
