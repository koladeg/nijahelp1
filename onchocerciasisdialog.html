        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Onchocerciasis is an insect-borne disease caused by a parasite Onchocerca volvulus and transmitted by blackflies of the species Simulium damnosum.<br />
         Onchocerciasis is often called "river blindness" because the blackfly which transmits the disease abounds in fertile riverside areas, that frequently remain uninhabited for fear of infection</p>
       <p>O. volvulus carry immature forms of the parasite from human to human. In the human body, the immature parasites form nodules in the subcutaneous tissue, where they mature to adult worms.<br />
        After mating, the female adult worm can release up to 1000 microfilariae (first-stage larvae) a day.<br />
         These move through the body, and when they die they cause a variety of conditions, including blindness, skin rashes, lesions, intense itching and skin depigmentation. </p>

           <h3>Prevention</h3>
           <ol>
           <p>In a number of countries, onchocerciasis has been controlled through spraying of blackfly breeding sites with insecticide. In addition, a drug is available that kills the microfilariae, alleviating symptoms and reducing transmission.</p>

           <h3>Treatment</h3>
           <p>Much progress has been made in fighting the disease in several countries through control of the blackfly, however, the disease can now also be treated with an annual dose of the drug ivermectine, Mectizan, which also relieves the severe skin itching caused by the disease.</p>
