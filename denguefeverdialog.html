        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Dengue fever is a painful, debilitating mosquito-borne (Aedes aegypti) viral disease associated with urban environments
        and manifests as sudden onset of fever and severe headache; occasionally produces shock and hemorrhage leading to death in 5% of case </p>
        <p>Dengue fever is transmitted by the bite of an Aedes mosquito infected with a dengue virus.<br />
         The mosquito becomes infected when it bites a person with dengue virus in their blood. <br />
         It can't be spread directly from one person to another person.</p>

           <h3>Treatment</h3>
           <p>There is no specific medicine to treat dengue infection. If you think you may have dengue fever,<br />
            you should use pain relievers with acetaminophen and avoid medicines with aspirin, which could worsen bleeding.<br />
             You should also rest, drink plenty of fluids, and see your doctor. If you start to feel worse in the first 24 hours after your fever goes down,<br />
              you should get to a hospital immediately to be checked for complications.</p>
