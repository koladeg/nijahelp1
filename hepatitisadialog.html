        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Hepatitis A is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV).
        The virus is spread when an uninfected (or unvaccinated) person eats or drinks something contaminated by the stool of an HAV-infected person: this is called faecal-oral transmission<br />
        The disease is closely associated with a lack of safe water,inadequate sanitation and poor personal hygiene.<br />
         Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A infection does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but it can cause debilitating symptoms</p>

           <h3>Symptoms</h3>
           <h5>The symptoms of hepatitis A range from mild to severe and is usually 14 to 28 days after infection.<br />
           Not everyone who is infected will have all of the following symptoms.</h5>
           <ol>
           <li>Fever</li>
           <li>Malaise</li>
           <li>Loss of appetite</li>
           <li>Diarrhea</li>
           <li>Nausea.</li>
           <li>Abdominal discomfort.</li>
           <li>Dark-colored urine</li>
           <li>Jaundice (a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) </li>
           </ol>
           <p>Adults have signs and symptoms of illness more often than children, and the severity of disease and mortality increases in older age groups.<br />
            Infected children under six years of age do not usually experience noticeable symptoms, and only 10% develop jaundice.<br />
            Among older children and adults, infection usually causes more severe symptoms, with jaundice occurring in more than 70% of cases.<br />
             Most people recover in several weeks - or sometimes months - without complications.</p>

           <h3>Prevention</h3>
           <ul>
           <li>Improved sanitation and Hepatitis A immunization are the most effective ways to combat the disease</li>
           <li>Adequate supplies of safe-drinking water and proper disposal of sewage within communities, combined with personal hygiene practices,<br />
            such as regular hand-washing, reduce the spread of HAV.</li>
            <li>Several hepatitis A vaccines are available internationally. All are similar in terms of how well they protect people from the virus and their side-effects.<br />
             No vaccine is licensed for children younger than one year of age.</li>
             <li>There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A. Recovery from symptoms following infection may be slow and take several weeks or months.<br />
             Therapy is aimed at maintaining comfort and adequate nutritional balance, including replacement of fluids that are lost from vomiting and diarrhea.</li>
