        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Leishmaniasis is caused by parasitic protozoa of the genus Leishmania. Humans are infected via the bite of phlebotomine sandflies, which breed in forest areas, caves, or the burrows of small rodents.<br />
        There are four main types of the disease:</p>
        <ul>
           <li>In cutaneous forms, skin ulcers usually form on exposed areas, such as the face, arms and legs.<br />
           These usually heal within a few months, leaving scars.</li>
           <li>Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis produces disseminated and chronic skin lesions resembling those of lepromatous leprosy.<br />
            It is difficult to treat.</li>
           <li>In mucocutaneous forms, the lesions can partially or totally destroy the mucous membranes of the nose, mouth and throat cavities and surrounding tissues.</li>
           <li>Visceral leishmaniasis, also known as kala azar, is characterized by high fever, substantial weight loss, swelling of the spleen and liver, and anaemia.<br />
            If left untreated, the disease can have a fatality rate as high as 100% within two years.</li>
        </ul>

           <h3>Prevention</h3>
           <ol>
           <li>Early diagnosis and effective case management</li>
           <li>Vector control: Control methods include insecticide spray, use of insecticide treated nets</li>
           <li>Wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts when outside</li>
           </ol>
        </div>
    
        <div data-role="collapsible" data-inset="false">
           <h3>Treatment</h3>
           <p>People infected with cutaneous leishmaniasis should seek treatment right away, as the skin disease can spread to the nose or mouth (called mucosal leishmaniasis).<br />
            It is even more critical to diagnose and treat visceral leishmaniasis as soon as possible, because failure to treat can lead to death</p>
