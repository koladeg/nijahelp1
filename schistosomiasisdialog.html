        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Schistosomiasis, or bilharzia, is a parasitic disease caused by flatworms of the genus Schistosoma.<br />
        Early forms of the parasites, which are released by freshwater snails, penetrate the skin of people in the water.<br />
        In the body, the immature parasites develop into adult schistosomes, which live in the blood vessels.<br />
        The females release eggs, some of which are passed out of the body in the urine or faeces. Others are trapped in body tissues, causing an immune reaction. </p>
        <p>In urinary schistosomiasis, there is progressive damage to the bladder, ureters and kidneys.<br />
         In intestinal schistosomiasis, there is progressive enlargement of the liver and spleen, intestinal damage, and hypertension of the abdominal blood vessels. </p>

           <h3>Symptoms</h3>
           <h5>Symptoms of schistosomiasis are caused by the body's reaction to the worms' eggs, not by the worms themselves.<br />
           The effects are usually reversible with treatment. Chronic schistosomiasis may affect people's ability to work and in some cases can result in death.</h5>
           <ol>
           <h5>Intestinal schistosomiasis can result in:</h5>
           <li>Abdominal pain</li>
           <li>Diarrhoea</li>
           <li>Blood in the stool</li>
           </ol>
           <ol>
           <h5>Urogenital schistosomiasis can result in: </h5>
           <li>Haematuria (blood in urine)</li>
           <li>Fibrosis of the bladder and ureter, and kidney damage (in advanced cases)</li>
           <li>Bladder cancer (a possible late-stage complication).</li>
           <li>Genital lesions (in women)</li>
           <li>Vaginal bleeding (in women)</li>
           <li>Pain during sexual intercourse and nodules in the vulva (in women)</li>
           <li>Pathology of the seminal vesicles, prostate and other organs (in men)</li>
           </ol>
           <ol>
           <h5>In children, schistosomiasis can cause</h5>
           <li>Anaemia</li>
           <li>Stunting</li>
           <li>A reduced ability to learn</li>
           </ol>
        </div>
  
        <div data-role="collapsible" data-inset="false">
           <h3>Prevention</h3>
           <ol>
           <p>Prevention and control of schistosomiasis is based on:</p>
           <li>Preventive treatment</li>
           <li>Snail control</li>
           <li>Improved sanitation and health education</li>
           </ol>
        </div>
    
        <div data-role="collapsible" data-inset="false">
           <h3>Treatment</h3>
           <p>Praziquantel is the only available treatment against all forms of schistosomiasis that is effective, safe and low-cost.<br />
           The risk of developing severe disease is diminished and even reversed when treatment is initiated in childhood, even though re-infection may occur after treatment.</p>
