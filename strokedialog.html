        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>A stroke - also known as a brain attack - happens when a blood vessel in your brain gets blocked or bursts, and some of your brain cells die.<br />
         When brain cells die, the activities the brain controls are lost. This includes functions like as speech, movement, and memory.<br />
         If you know the symptoms, go to the hospital for immediate treatment. Getting treatment quickly means having a better chance of a full recovery.</p>

           <h3>Symptoms</h3>
           <ol>
           <li>Numbness or weakness of your face, arm or leg, especially on one side of the body.</li>
           <li>Confusion, trouble speaking or understanding.</li>
           <li>Trouble seeing in one or both eyes.</li>
           <li>Trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination.</li>
           <li>Severe headache with no known cause.</li>
           <li>Sudden nausea, fever, and vomiting that happens within minutes or hours.</li>
           <li>Fainting, confusion, convulsions, or coma. </li>
           </ol>

           <h3>Prevention</h3>
           <ol>
           <li>Get your blood pressure checked regularly - if it's high, your risk for stroke increases.</li>
           <li>Exercise and eat a low fat, low salt diet.</li>
           <li>Find out if you have an irregular heartbeat. You'll need medication to lower your risk for stroke.</li>
           <li>Stop smoking today - it doubles your risk.</li>
           <li>If you drink, limit it to two per day.</li>
           <li>Keep your cholesterol low and get it checked regularly.</li>
           <li>If you're diabetic, control it and watch what you eat.</li>
           <li>If you have circulation problems, get them treated.</li>
           </ol>

           <h3>Treatment</h3>
           <p>If you have any of these symptoms - even if they don't cause any pain and go away quickly - <strong>go to the hospital</strong>.<br />
            If you get treated quickly, you may be able to control the amount of damage to your brain.<br />
            If there is a blockage or bleeding, the doctor will try to treat it with drugs or surgery.
             Many people who have strokes must learn to talk or walk again. In the early stages of recovery, they can't remember things or can't move parts of their body.<br />
             Recovery takes time, work, support, and patience. Many people need special medical care. Learn more about recovery.</p>
