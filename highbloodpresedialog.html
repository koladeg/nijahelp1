        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>The force at which blood presses against the walls of your arteries is known as blood pressure.<br />
         Normally an individual's blood pressure rises and falls throughout the day. But for some it is always high.<br />
         Those are people with high blood pressure.</p>
         <p>High blood pressure, or hypertension, can cause severe damage to the heart, eyes, and kidneys.<br />
          It increases chances of having a stroke, contracting atherosclerosis, or developing heart disease.</p>

           <h3>Symptoms</h3>
          <p>High blood pressure is known as "the silent killer" because you can have it for years without realizing it.<br />
           The only way to find out is to have your blood pressure taken.</p>

           <h3>Prevention</h3>
           <ol>
           <p>The steps for preventing high blood pressure are the same as the steps for treating high blood pressure.<br />
            First and foremost is to have your blood pressure taken at least once a year by a health care professional.<br />
             This is more important every year as everyone's blood pressure rises naturally over their lifetime. Other suggestions include:</p>
           <li>Exercise regularly.</li>
           <li>Stop smoking and drinking.</li>
           <li>Eat a healthier, salt-free diet.</li>
           <li>Reduce your stress level.</li>
           <li>Lose weight if you're overweight.</li>
           </ol>
