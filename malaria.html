        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>malaria is caused by single-cell parasitic protozoa Plasmodium;<br /> transmitted to humans via the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito;<br /> 
        parasites multiply in the liver attacking red blood cells resulting in cycles of fever, chills, and sweats accompanied by anemia; 
        <br />death due to damage to vital organs and interruption of blood supply to the brain;<br /> 
        endemic in 100, mostly tropical, countries with 90% of cases and the majority of 1.5-2.5 million estimated annual deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. 
        <br />There are an estimated 300 million acute cases of malaria every year around the world, resulting in more than one million deaths. 
        <br />Approximately 90 percent of these deaths occur in Africa, mostly in young children. 
        <br />Malaria in Nigeria, according to the Nigerian Ministry of Health (MoH), is responsible for 60 percent of outpatient visits to health facilities; 
        <br />30 percent of childhood deaths; 25 percent of deaths in children under one year; and 11 percent of maternal deaths </p>

           <h3>Treatment</h3>
           <p>WHO recommends artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria caused by the P. falciparum parasite. 
           <br />By combining two active ingredients with different mechanisms of action, ACTs are the most effective antimalarial medicines available today.
           <br />WHO currently recommends five ACTs for use against P. falciparum malaria. 
           <br />The choice of ACT should be based on the results of therapeutic efficacy studies against local strains of P. falciparum malaria.</p>
