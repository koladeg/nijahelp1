        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Human African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, is a parasitic disease.<br />
        The parasites are transmitted to humans by tsetse fly bites which have acquired their infection from human beings or from animals harbouring the human pathogenic parasites.<br />
        Tsetse flies are found just in sub-Saharan Africa though only certain species transmit the disease. </p>

        <div data-role="collapsible" data-inset="false">
           <h3>Symptoms</h3>
           <h5>Without treatment, sleeping sickness is considered fatal.<br />
           In the first stage (the haemolymphatic phase), the parasites multiply in subcutaneous tissues, blood and lymph.</h5>
           <ol>
           <li>Fever</li>
           <li>Headaches</li>
           <li>Joint pains</li>
           <li>Itching</li>
           </ol>
           <h5>In the second stage (the neurological phase), the parasites cross the blood-brain barrier to infect the central nervous system.</h5>
           <ol>
           <li>Disturbance of the sleep cycle</li>
           <li>Changes of behavior</li>
           <li>Confusion</li>
           <li>Sensory disturbances</li>
           <li>Poor coordination</li>
           </ol>
           <p>Diagnosis must be made as early as possible in order to avoid complicated, difficult and risky treatment procedures.</p>
        </div>
  
        <div data-role="collapsible" data-inset="false">
           <h3>Prevention</h3>
           <ol>
           <p>There is no vaccine or drug for prophylaxis against African trypanosomiasis. Preventive measures are aimed at minimizing contact with tsetse flies.<br />
            Local residents are usually aware of the areas that are heavily infested and they can provide advice about places to avoid.<br />
             Other helpful measures include:</p>
           <li>Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants of medium-weight material in neutral colors that blend with the background environment.<br />
            Tsetse flies are attracted to bright or dark colors, and they can bite through lightweight clothing.</li>
           <li>Inspect vehicles before entering. The flies are attracted to the motion and dust from moving vehicles.</li>
           <li>Avoid bushes. The tsetse fly is less active during the hottest part of the day but will bite if disturbed.</li>
           <li>Use insect repellent. Permethrin-impregnated clothing and insect repellent have not been proved to be particularly effective against tsetse flies,<br />
            but they will prevent other insect bites that can cause illness.</li>
           </ol>

           <h3>Treatment</h3>
           <p>The type of treatment depends on the stage of the disease. The drugs used in the first stage of the disease are of lower toxicity and easier to administer.<br />
           The earlier the disease is identified, the better the prospect of a cure. </p>
           <p>Treatment success in the second stage depends on a drug that can cross the blood-brain barrier to reach the parasite.<br />
           Such drugs are toxic and complicated to administer. Four drugs are registered for the treatment of sleeping sickness and provided free of charge to endemic countries. </p>
           <ol>
           <h5>First stage treatment:</h5>
           <li><strong>Pentamidine:</strong> used for the treatment of the first stage of T.b. gambiense sleeping sickness.<br />
            Despite non-negligible undesirable effects, it is in general well tolerated by patients. </li>
           <li><strong>Suramin:</strong> used for the treatment of the first stage of T.b. rhodesiense. It provokes certain undesirable effects, in the urinary tract and allergic reactions.</li>
           </ol>
           <ol>
           <h5>Second stage treatment:</h5>
           <li><strong>Melarsoprol:</strong> used in both forms of infection. It is derived from arsenic and has many undesirable side effects.<br />
            The most dramatic is reactive encephalopathy (encephalopathic syndrome) which can be fatal (3% to 10%). An increase in resistance to the drug has been observed in several foci particularly in central Africa. </li>
           <li><strong>Eflornithine:</strong> less toxic than melarsoprol, but only effective against T.b. gambiense. The regimen is strict and difficult to apply</li>
           <li>A combination treatment of <strong>nifurtimox and eflornithine</strong> has been recently introduced (2009). It simplifies the use of eflornithine in monotherapy, but unfortunately it is not effective for T.b. rhodesiense.</li>
