        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness. It was discovered first in Lassa, Borno State, Nigeria in 1969.<br />
        However, it can be found in other places, especially in West Africa e.g. Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.<br />
        It is transmitted to humans from contacts with food or household items contaminated with rodent excreta and primary animal host of the Lassa virus is the Natal Multimammate Mouse (Mastomys natalensis), an animal indigenous to most of Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
        <p>Replication for Lassa virus is fast. It also infects almost every tissue in the human body.<br />
         It starts with the mucosa, intestine, lungs and urinary system, and then progresses to the vascular system. </p>

           <h3>Prevention</h3>
           <p>Control of the Mastomys rodent population is impractical, so measures are limited to keeping rodents out of homes and food supplies, as well as maintaining effective personal hygiene.<br />
            Gloves, masks, laboratory coats, and goggles are advised while in contact with an infected person</p>

        <div data-role="collapsible" data-inset="false">
           <h3>Treatment</h3>
           <p>All persons suspected of Lassa fever infection should be admitted to isolation facilities and their body fluids and excreta properly disposed of.</p>
