        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Meningococcal meningitis is a serious bacterial infection of the meninges that affects the brain membrane.<br />
         It can cause severe brain damage and is fatal in 50% of cases if untreated.</p>
         <p>The bacteria are transmitted from person-to-person through droplets of respiratory or throat secretions from carriers.<br />
          Close and prolonged contact: such as kissing, sneezing or coughing on someone, or living in close quarters (such as a dormitory, sharing eating or drinking utensils) with an infected person (a carrier) facilitates the spread of the disease.</p>

           <h3>Symptoms</h3>
           <ol>
           <li>A stiff neck</li>
           <li>High fever</li>
           <li>Sensitivity to light</li>
           <li>Confusion</li>
           <li>Headaches</li>
           <li>Vomiting</li>

           <h3>Prevention</h3>
           <ol>
           <p>There are three types of vaccines available for Neisseria meningitidis, the bacteria with the potential to cause large epidemics.</p>
           <li>Polysaccharide vaccines have been available to prevent the disease: groups A, C, W, W135 and Y of N. meningitides.</li>
           <li>For group B, polysaccharide vaccines cannot be developed. Consequently, vaccines against group B developed in Norway, in Cuba and Netherlands are outer membrane proteins (OMP).</li>
           <p>Meningococcal conjugate vaccines against group C have been available and widely used.</p>
           </ol>

           <h3>Treatment</h3>
           <p>Meningococcal disease is potentially fatal and should always be viewed as a medical emergency.<br />
           Admission to a hospital or health centre is necessary, although isolation of the patient is not necessary.<br />
           Appropriate antibiotic treatment must be started as soon as possible, ideally after the lumbar puncture (a clinical examination) has been carried out if such a puncture can be performed immediately.</p>
          
          <p>A range of antibiotics can treat the infection, including penicillin, ampicillin, chloramphenicol and ceftriaxone. Under epidemic conditions in areas with limited health infrastructure and resources, oily chloramphenicol or ceftriaxone are the drugs of choice because a single dose has been shown to be effective on meningococcal meningitis.</p>
