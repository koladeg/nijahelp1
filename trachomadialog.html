            <h1>Trachoma</h1>
        </div><!-- /header -->

          <div data-role="content">
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Trachoma is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis which spreads through contact with eye discharge from the infected person (on towels, handkerchiefs, fingers, etc.) and through transmission by eye-seeking flies.<br />
        Thus, infection is frequently passed from child to child and from child to mother, especially where there are shortages of water, numerous flies, and crowded living conditions.</p>

           <h3>Symptoms</h3>
           <ol>
           <li>The inside of the eyelid may be scarred so severely.</li>
           <li>The eyelid turns inward and the lashes rub on the eyeball, scarring the cornea (the front of the eye).</li>
           <li>If untreated, this condition leads to the formation of irreversible corneal opacities and blindness.</li>
           </ol>

           <h3>Prevention</h3>
           <ol>
           <p>Primary interventions advocated for preventing trachoma infection include:</p>
           <li>Improved sanitation</li>
           <li>Reduction of fly breeding sites</li>
           <li>Increased facial cleanliness (with clean water) among children at risk of disease</li>
           </ol>
        </div>
    
        <div data-role="collapsible" data-inset="false">
           <h3>Treatment</h3>
           <p>The scaring and visual change for trachoma can be reversed by a simple surgical procedure performed at village level which reverses the inturned eyelashes.</p>
           <p>Good personal and environmental hygiene has been proven to be successful in combating trachoma.<br />
            Encouraging the washing of children's faces, improved access to water, and proper disposal of human and animal waste has been shown to decrease the number of trachoma infections in communities.</p>
