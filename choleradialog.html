        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Cholera is a bacterial infection. It is carried in water and in feces, and can be caught by drinking infected water or by eating food that has been contaminated with feces.<br />
         Feces can get on to food mainly through people not washing their hands before preparing or eating food, or through flies landing on feces and then on food.<br />
         Cholera epidemics usually happen in areas where there is no piped fresh water or sewage.<br />
          Open drains and sewage and open water supplies create conditions for cholera epidemics.<br />
           For this reason, cholera is a problem mainly in rural areas or in areas that have been struck by natural disaster and have no piped water supply.</p>
